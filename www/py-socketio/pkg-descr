Python implementation of the Socket.IO realtime server.

Features:
- Compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.3+.
- Supports large number of clients even on modest hardware when used with
  an asynchronous server based on eventlet or gevent. For development and
  testing, any WSGI complaint multi-threaded server can be used.
- Includes a WSGI middleware that integrates Socket.IO traffic with 
  standard WSGI applications.
- Broadcasting of messages to all connected clients, or to subsets of 
  them assigned to “rooms”.
- Optional support for multiple servers, connected through a messaging
  queue such as Redis or RabbitMQ.
- Send messages to clients from external processes, such as Celery
  workers or auxiliary scripts.
- Event-based architecture implemented with decorators that hides the
  details of the protocol.
- Support for HTTP long-polling and WebSocket transports.
- Support for XHR2 and XHR browsers.
- Support for text and binary messages.
- Support for gzip and deflate HTTP compression.
- Configurable CORS responses, to avoid cross-origin problems with browsers.
